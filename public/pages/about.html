            this website is crafted as a single page angular app, 
            with content served by a lightweight node.js back-end, deployed to heroku.
        </p>

        <p>
            if you are a developer you may think that is slightly over-complicated for a site like this, 
            but i just wanted an excuse to experiment with those technologies.
